    <h3>Description</h3>

    <p>A popular dish is <em><strong>Mofongo</strong></em>, made with mashed fried green plantains mixed with garlic, herbs, olive oil, and pork cracklings. This recipe is a trifecta Mofongo that uses fried green plantains, yellow plantains, and yuca, or cassava root.

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <p>Note: This recipe is fairly straightforward, but requies a bit of multitasking. The steps that pertain to the trifongo will be labeled with a <em><strong>T</strong></em>, and caldo steps with a <em><strong>C</strong></em> to include their specific ingredients. Have all of your ingredients readily available. Lets begin!</p>
    <ol>
        <li><em><strong>T</strong></em>: In a large pot, add the yuca, chopped culantro, garlic cloves and bay leaf and bring to a boil. Cook until fork tender, drain, discard the herbs and spices and set aside in a large mixing bowl.</li>
        <li><em><strong>C</strong></em>: While the yuca is boiling, work on the caldo by combining the chicken broth, culantro sprig, bay leaf, garlic cloves, peppercorns, paprika, and cumin seeds in a medium saucepan. Bring to a gentle boil and cook for 15-20 minutes. Strain out and discard the herbs and spices and reduce the heat to low to keep warm.</li>
        <li>Add oil to a frying pan and fry the yellow plantains over medium heat until golden brown on both sides. Place into the large mixing bowl.</li>
        <li>Next fry the green plantains until golden and place in the large mixing bowl.</li>
        <li><em><strong>T</strong></em>: When the yuca, green plantains, and yellow plantains are in the bowl together, add a large pinch of salt, the crushed pork rinds, mashed garlic cloves, and the melted butter. Using a potato masher, work all ingredients into a mass. Season with adobo and more salt to your liking.</li>
        <li>Using a small teacup or with your hands (authentic way), shape the trifongo mass and place in a soup bowl.</li>
        <li>Finally, ladle a cup of the warm broth over the trifongo, serve and enjoy!</li>
