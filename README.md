# odin-recipes

In this project, I worked on developing an index.html and several other html pages about recipes for various meals I enjoy. I linked the pages of each recipe to the index page for easy access.

Each recipe page has an embedded picture along with both unordered and ordered lists to provide ingredients and steps. 

I used VScode to develop these pages, and it was a fun experience!
